# Questions

- Should each individual scenario have its own file?
- Are the Regex escape characters necessary or best practice?
- How robust should sad path testing be?
- Each scenario should only have one 'given' and 'when'?
- Are there ways to assert validations using capybara/cucumber, or is this strictly about testing user behavior?
- Or, do you need RSpec in order to make assertions?
